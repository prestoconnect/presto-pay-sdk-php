# Security policy

This SDK signs and verifies payment requests with a merchant private key. If you find a vulnerability — in
signature verification, key handling, webhook verification, or anywhere else — please report it privately
rather than opening a public issue.

## Reporting

Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/prestoconnect/presto-pay-sdk-php/security/advisories/new)
to report privately. Include:

- the affected version(s) and PHP version;
- steps to reproduce, or a minimal example;
- what you'd expect to happen instead.

## Scope

In scope: this library's own code (`src/`). The samples under `sample/` are for local demonstration only; real
merchant or Presto staging credentials must never be committed (see each sample's `.gitignore` and `.env.example`).

## Supported versions

Pre-1.0: only the latest published version is supported. Once 1.0 ships, this section will list which major
versions still receive security fixes.
